# 🥤 Anime Coke Edition  

Hey there, anime lover! 👋  

Welcome to my **Anime Coke Edition** project! 🎉 This is where I mixed the coolness of Coke with the epic worlds of **Chainsaw Man** and **Pokémon**. It's all about vibrant colors, fun designs, and a dash of anime magic—all brought to life with just **HTML** and **CSS**. Hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I loved creating it! ✨

## ✨ What Makes It Fun  

- **Anime Awesomeness**: Designs inspired by the intense vibes of **Chainsaw Man** and the nostalgia of **Pokémon**.  
- **Bright and Bold**: A colorful and eye-catching layout that screams "anime energy!"  
- **Responsive Design**: Looks amazing on desktops, tablets, and phones—because anime fans deserve the best everywhere.
